The goal is to control the output interval for the customer interface (H1) - keyword: In Home Display. The meter should output the following instantaneous values: Meter reading and instantaneous power (in Watt) with date and time per energy direction - active energy (optionally also reactive energy) incl. Obiskennziffer. The output interval must be adjustable in a second grid (between 1 and 10 seconds) so that the meter readings are always output every full 1/4 hour (ie xx: 00, xx: 15, etc.). This allows comparison with the load profile registered in the meter. The output interval is set via the WAN interface of the meter.

Customer wishes to change the output interval for his customer interface (H1) and inform the NB about this. As part of a daily routine, the transfer takes place on his meter.

The output interval for the customer interface (H1) in the meter has been successfully set / changed.
