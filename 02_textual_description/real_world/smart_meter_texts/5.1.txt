Alarms sent by one of the system components must be uniquely identifiable:
* Origin of the ALARM
* Type of trigger of ALARM
* Type of ALARMs (for example, by meaningful plain text message)
* Unique timestamp
Examples of security events that can trigger ALARMs are listed in the "OE Requirement Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering" section B.4.
