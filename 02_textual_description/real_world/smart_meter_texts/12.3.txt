The maintenance interface or at least the compromised role on the terminal/gateway (WZ/WG) must be disabled automatically for a certain period of time (parameterizable) after multiple erroneous login attempts (number of errors must be configurable). After expiry of the period, the maintenance interface is reactivated. The state change triggers an ALARM or EVENT to the central system.
