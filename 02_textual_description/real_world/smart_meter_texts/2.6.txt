The terminal is released by a command from the central system for on-site (re) engagement.
The activation takes place as follows. First a release command is transmitted from the central system to the terminal. The terminal indicates this condition (e.g., READY, LED, ..).
This status is transferred to the central system as ALARM or EVENT and an entry is created in the logbook.
Second, from this time it can be turned on directly on the control of the terminal.
The terminal must indicate this status change (e.g., CONNECTED).
This status is transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT and an entry is made in the logbook of the terminal.
