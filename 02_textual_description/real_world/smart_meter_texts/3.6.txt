For reasons of data protection law, the display of the consumption time series, for example: load profile on the display via the call key, is only permitted in special cases. It must be possible to activate or deactivate the display of the consumption time series via the local service interface (TO) of the meter. The status is to be entered in the logbook. In the basic setting of the counter, the display of the consumption time series must always be deactivated.
Whether the display of the consumption time series is active or inactive is decided by the customer. He informs the NB (eg via web portal, call center, letter, ...).
When the consumption time series display is activated, the customer has the option of viewing the consumption time series, for example: load profile for the last 60 days, directly on the counter display. Unless it is in the course of a customer change to a new customer, based on the plant. Then a 60-day deactivation of the consumption time series display for data protection reasons is necessary.
