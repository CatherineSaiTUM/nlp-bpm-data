It must be possible (via the service interface (WZ) at Eindger√§ten) to deposit a time for the installation of already loaded in terminals / gateways firmware. This must be possible for individual devices and device groups. Likewise, the time must be "immediately after the firmware is available". This ensures the function of the entire system (eg: security update, change of technology from PLC G3 to IEEE1901.2 or the frequency band from CENELEC A to FCC, etc.).
A logbook entry is generated. This state is transmitted to the central system as an ALARM or EVENT when the transmission link (WAN) is available.
