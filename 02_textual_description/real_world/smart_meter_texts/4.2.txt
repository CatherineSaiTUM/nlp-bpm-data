It must be possible via the WAN interface of the terminal / gateway to set a time for the installation start of the already loaded in terminals / gateways firmware. This must be possible for individual devices and device groups. Likewise, the time instant must be transmitted after the firmware has been downloaded. This ensures the function of the entire system (eg: security update, change of technology from PLC G3 to IEEE1901.2 or the frequency band from CENELEC A to FCC, etc.).
