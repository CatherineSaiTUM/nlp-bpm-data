All devices / gateway as well as the central system must support an update or upgrade of its software (ie the non-metrological part). Triggered by a command from the NB, the software to be updated is downloaded to the terminal / gateway. After the download, the terminal / gateway tests whether the software was complete and whether it was transmitted without error. The status of the transfer should be synchronized with the central system to get an overview of the upload.
