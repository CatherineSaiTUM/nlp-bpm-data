For the breaker of the meter, it should be possible to configure a circuit program, divided into daily, weekly, seasonal and annual programs, taking into account weekly, holiday and special days.
The switching programs are managed centrally and, if necessary, transferred to the desired counters. For control purposes, the circuit program must also be read-back. Any change to the circuit program, regardless of whether it is remotely executed, must be recorded in a logbook!
