Each meter has an individual security key that is not publicly known. Meters that have to be calibrated/tested must temporarily transmit all required cryptographic parameters to the testing laboratory using a secure way.
The external testing laboratory is then able to carry out the calibration or testing of the device.
Each activation of the calibration mode must be recorded in the logbook of the meter.
