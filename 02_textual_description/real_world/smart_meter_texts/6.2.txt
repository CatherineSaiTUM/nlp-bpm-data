The counter serves as a possible replacement for a ripple control device or a timer (an interruptible load is switched directly with the breaker of the counter - this can be omitted a ripple control device or a timer in combination with a contactor).
In principle, the breaker of the counter follows a switching program specified by the central system and stored in the counter. However, it must be possible from the central system to override the circuit program for the breaker with a spontaneous command (for example: Breaker "OFF" or "ON"). The next opposite command (either from the internal counter charts or externally when needed) changes the state of the breaker. The position of the breaker or each switching cycle specified by the switching program must be reported back to the central system. The breaker must also be visually displayed on the counter display.
In the case of converter meters, a relay integrated in the meter is actuated instead of the breaker.
