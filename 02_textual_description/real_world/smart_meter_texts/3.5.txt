For reasons of data protection law, the display of consumption time series, for example: load profile on the display via the call button, is only permitted in special cases. It must be possible to activate or deactivate the display of the consumption time series via the meter's WAN interface. The status is to be transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT and entered in the logbook. In the basic setting of the meter, the display of the consumption time series must always be deactivated.
Whether the display of the consumption time series, for example: load profile is active or inactive, is decided by the customer. He informs the NB (via web portal, via the call center, letter, ...). A synchronization of the device setting with respect to consumption time series display is usefully 1 - 2 times a day
(Customer should not be able to change the setting for load profile display every minute).
When the consumption time series display is activated, the customer has the option to view the load profile for the last 60 days directly on the meter display. Unless it is in the course of a customer change to a new customer, based on the plant. Then a 60-day deactivation of the consumption time series display for data protection reasons is necessary.

Customer wishes to activate the consumption time series display on the meter display and notify the NB or the customer wishes to deactivate the consumption time series display on the meter display and inform the NB about this.

When activated, the consumption time series is available on the meter display for customers.
When deactivated, the consumption time series is no longer visible on the meter display for customers.
In both cases, the meter reports its status to the central system as ALARM or EVENT ("LP Display OFF" or "LP Display ON") and entry in the logbook of the meter.
