It must basically be possible to make an on-site reading of the meter using a mobile device via the service interface of the meter.
In order to meet the strict data protection regulations, the cryptographic parameters that authorize the readout of the affected meter must be stored in the mobile device.
It must therefore not be possible with these cryptographic parameters to read several or all terminals of the terminal equipment.
The NB will store the cryptographic parameters in the mobile device for the affected meter and send a service technician to the affected customer system to read out the affected meter.
The data thus obtained must be transmitted to the central system.
Each readout must be noted as access in the logbook.
The scope and data content is definable.
The following applies to division meters: On-site read-out is only possible if a communication interface based on the security requirements from "OE Requirements Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering" is provided on the division meter.
