All meters must support an update or upgrade of their software. Triggered by a command from the NB, the updated software is downloaded to the counter. After the download, the counter first tests whether the software has been transferred completely and without error. An example process is described in the "OE Requirements Catalog for End-to-End Security Smart Metering" in Appendix A.3.
