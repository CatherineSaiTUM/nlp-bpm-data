Configurable terminals Parameters must be changed on site via the service interface (WZ) of the terminals. e.g. Change of meter reading unit (registers, load profile, accumulation times and pre-memory depth, power quality etc.), constant increase for calibration, increase of the number of decimal places, permitted deletion commands (for example once without calibration switch, logbooks).
