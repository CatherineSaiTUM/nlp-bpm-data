The activation takes place as follows: a) A release command is transmitted to the terminal via the service interface (WZ).
The terminal indicates this condition (e.g., READY) and an entry in the logbook is generated.
This state is transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT.
b) From this time can be turned on directly on the control of the terminal.
