The current time is checked.
With a recognized time deviation of up to 2 seconds, no action may be taken!
Behavior in case of deviations of the time:
If there is a time deviation between 2 and 9 seconds, the time must be synchronized, an entry in the logbook does not take place with a time deviation greater than 9 seconds, the time must be set and entry in the logbook and in the load profile (counter reading with date and time and status entry). The time chronology ("numbering") of the measured values must be retained. Synchronization must be possible via the service interface (WZ) / maintenance interface (WG) of the terminals / gateways.
