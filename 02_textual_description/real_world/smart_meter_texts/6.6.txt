For the breaker of the meter, it should be possible to configure a circuit program, divided into daily, weekly, seasonal and annual programs, taking into account weekly, holiday and special days.
The service interface (WZ) of the meter must also be able to change the circuit program locally if the safety requirements are met. For control purposes, the circuit program must also be read-back.
(Feedback to the central system via changed circuit program, or also corresponding note in the logbook, so for example: local switching table change). A logbook entry is generated. This state is transmitted to the central system as an ALARM or EVENT when the transmission link (WAN) is available.
