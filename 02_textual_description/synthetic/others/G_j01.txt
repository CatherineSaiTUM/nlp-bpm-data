Name: Farming Bot

Players want to create custom farming bots, that help them gather
resources. First you have to find out which resources you want. Up to
10 resources in parallel can be collected, some resources are more urgently needed
than others. Some resources are required to create tools that are needed to
gather other resources. (create a custom logic of the dependencies in your game).

After all preferences are collected, your bot starts farming. Sometimes, 
random natural disasters strike and set your bot back. Whenever some milestones
are reached, you are notified.

During farming it is possible to update the list of to be farmed materials (at
all times).

After the bot is finished, you should be able to brag to selected friends
and/or send them materials.
