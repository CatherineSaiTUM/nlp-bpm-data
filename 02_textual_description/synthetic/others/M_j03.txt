Title: Contract

For your contract project you need parts from several web shops. In order to
find out which web shop has the right parts, you have to query them all, and
find out how much they can deliver, at which price, and how long it will take.

Create a list of parts that you order from each shop. If one shop has not enough 
parts, order from several shops. Always use the cheapest parts.

The parts arrive in batches in a random order, typically they are +/- 2 days
earlier/later.  

When the first parts arrive you start building. Sometimes you have to reorder parts.
If your stock (for a single part) falls below 5, you reorder (the cheapest), if it
falls below 3 you reorder again (the fastest). If it is zero, you write a mail
to your friends, complaining about the webshops.
