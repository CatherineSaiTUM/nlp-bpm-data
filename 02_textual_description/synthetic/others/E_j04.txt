Title: Internship

You can enter a topic that interests you, and how much money you want. You can
also enter experience and hobbies. Several offers will arrive (at arbitrary
points in time). You can accept or deny offers. As soon as an offer is accepted, 
all other offers become invalid. You have to write at least 3 status updates
about your internship (every week). The company has to write 3 status updates
about you. After the internship is finished you can recommend the company to a
list of friends (via twitter). Separate tweets are sent in parallel.
