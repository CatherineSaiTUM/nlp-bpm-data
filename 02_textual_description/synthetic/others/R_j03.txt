Title: Service for Your Fridge

Your fridge produces strange noises. You describe the symptoms, and send them
together with the type of fridge to the central fridge service center.  They
select a local service facility (which all have their own way of interacting
with customers).

The service facility makes an appointment. They arrive at a random time, and
sometimes have to leave without repairing your fridge, because they need
additional parts.

After your fridge is repaired, you have to confirm that it is OK again. You
can rate the service facility.
