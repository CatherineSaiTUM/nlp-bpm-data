Title: New Application for Registering for an USI course

If you want to register for a course at the sports institute, you need to
select a course. If slots are free, the system tells you the courses, and
dates. Select one. Next, you need to check if you already have an account at
the sports institute. If not, you need to check whether you are registered at
an eligible university. If you are, register your account. If you are not,
request an activation and wait for a response. As soon as you have an account,
log into it. The application is also connected to your twitter account, and
lets you tweet to friends who might want to join you, you can complete the
registration for the course and provide the payment information. In the end, you
will receive a course ticket.
