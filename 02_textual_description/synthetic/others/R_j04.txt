Title: Car Service

The police has a new app to remind you of your car service. The process is
started after a successful service. When a service is necessary, the system
checks if your car is still registered. If it is registered, you are notified.
If you do not go to the service, you are fined after 30 days. At the car
service facility the mechanic enters the problems of your car for reference.
While you wait (can take several days), you get status updates via email).
You can pay through the app, when the repair is done. The mechanic enters
that the repair was successful and you got your "Pickerl". The mechanic enters
the time for you next service.
