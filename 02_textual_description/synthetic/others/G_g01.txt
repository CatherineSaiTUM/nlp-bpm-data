Name: LAN Party

You are planning a LAN party for 10 friends, so the first thing you have to do
is to send invitations to these 10 friends. Next, you have to find out which
games they want to play. As soon as you have received a list of games, you can
appoint a date when the LAN party is going to happen. If 8 or more people agree
on this date, you are good to continue. Else, you have to appoint another date,
until 8 people are free to join you. While you find a date, you can find out if
you have all the games your guests want to play. If some are missing, download
them. Next, you should find out how much beer your friends will require. If you
do not have enough, buy what's missing. After that, you can enjoy the LAN
party.
