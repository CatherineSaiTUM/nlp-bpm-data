Title: DIY Repair of a Broken Smartphone Screen

A nifty online tool helps you with repairing your Smartphone on your own.
You start by entering the model and what is broken. The tool gives you the list
of materials, the list of tools, and (for each part) several ordering choices.
Some stuff you already have (e.g. some tools, screws). The tool also lets you contact friends
if you can borrow / buy something for cheap from them. The rest you buy.
Afterwards you receive instructions how to fix your phone. If it worked, send a review and/or video
of you fixing it. If it hasn't worked out, you can send it to an expert.
