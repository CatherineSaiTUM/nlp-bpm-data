Title: Robotic Burger Seller near the University of Vienna

The robot receives an order. It asks whether the customer wants a menu or just
the burger. If he wants a menu, the robot starts preparing the drink, which
depending on the size can take a variable amount of time. While doing so, he
asks if you want fries or wedges. If you want fries, he prepares the fries; if
you want wedges, he prepares wedges. Again the duration varies depending on the
size fries/wedges order. After that, he prepares the burger, and gives you
enthusiastic status updates every 30 seconds. Depending on the number of
ingredients, the duration for creating the burger varies. Your order is delivered
via a conveyor belt.
