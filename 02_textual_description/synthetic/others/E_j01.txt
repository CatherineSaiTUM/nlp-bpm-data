Title: Find a Job

You have to regularly report, to which companies you wrote job applications.
Based on your job applications, new potential job offers are sent to you.
Companies have to confirm that they received job applications and rate the
application. A job interview can be negotiated. When a company wants you to
work for them, you enter the probation phase. After probation phase, you can
rate the company and the company can rate you. Reviews for a company can only
be seen (by job applicants) after 1 year. If a job becomes permanent, the
process ends, unless you rated the company C or less, then you continue to
receive job offers, but no longer have to report.
