Title: Blizzard Online Character Generator

Blizzard creates a cool online tool for creating characters for their new WoW
expansion.  When creating a World of Warcraft character, you can start doing
two things: While you are setting up your account, you can already come up with
good character names. The setup of your account starts with checking whether
you have a battle.net account. If you do not have one yet, you enter the
account information and click the link you receive in the confirmation mail. As
soon as you have a battle.net account, you can check if you have an active WoW
subscription. If not, you can select the payment method. If you choose credit
card, enter your credit card information. If you choose your bank account,
enter your IBAN and BIC numbers. After that you can log into the game and
select realm, race and class of your character. Until now, you should have come
up with some good names. You enter them one by one until a name is still
available. You get a confirmation, and some selfies of your character, 
as soon as a expansion is released you get another message.
