Title: Storage management

First, the order is read from the automatic order management system. 
Then, it's checked if the first product from the order is in stock. 
If it's in stock then it's withdrawn from the warehouse.
However, if it's not in stock then it's reordered from the wholesaler.
Note, that if it was necessary to wait more then 10 days for the
arrival of the  product then a delivery delay penalty is automatically demanded
from the wholesaler. 
After the ordered product has arrived it's registered in the stock management system. 
Finally, it's checked if the whole order is ready for shipment. 
If the order is ready for shipment, a courier is requested and the products are packed
simultaneously and finally shipped. If it isn't then the next product from
the order is selected and the process starts again with checking if this
order is in stock or not.
