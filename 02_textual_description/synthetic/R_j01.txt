Write a process, that collects relevant information from a machine, and
calculated the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE). If the OEE falls below a
certain value/percentage, stop the machine and send an email to an engineer.
When the machine is restarted, continue measuring. When the machine is
disconnected, stop the process.
