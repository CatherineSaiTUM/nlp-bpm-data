Title: App For Participating at the Vienna Night Run

If you want to participate at the Vienna Night Run, you need to select a
starting block first. After that, you run for 5km and measure the time. If you
can do it in less than 25 minutes, you are good. If not, you need to train and
check until you have achieved this goal. After that, you can get your starting
number. Depending on when your work day ends, you have to find out whether you
can go there from home, or need to leave directly from work. If more than one
hour is left between your starting time and the end of your workday, you can go
there from home. Else, you need to leave directly from work. While running at
the Night Run, you run and drink at the same time. In the end, you receive your
final running time.
