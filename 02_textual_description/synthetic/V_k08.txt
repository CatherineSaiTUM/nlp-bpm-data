Title: Ordering in an Online Shop  

A customer that logs into an E-Shop system and has to wait for its login
confirmation (its credentials are checked by the system). If the login was
successful then the customer can continue to select products, else the shopping
experience stops. After selecting a product the customer has to add it to a
shopping cart, save the product and check if every product was already
selected. These steps repeat until all products were selected. Then the order
is finished by the shopping system and simultaneously payment and shipment for the order is prepared.
For the payment the customer has to enter its payment data
and has to wait until the bank confirms the payment.
While waiting for the payment confirmation the customer can enter its
shipping address (an independent billing address can be entered if the shipping
address is not equal to the billing address) . Finally if the address and the
payment steps are executed then the order will be finished by the system.
