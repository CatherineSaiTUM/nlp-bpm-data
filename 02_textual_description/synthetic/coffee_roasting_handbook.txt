# Coffee Roasting Handbook 1st Edition Exclusive!

# About our Coffee:

We roast our own coffee in the coffeehouse on a weekly basis. There are two primary things to know about our coffee roasting: where we get our beans and how we roast them.
Coffee does not grow in the United States. We import green coffee beans from the coffee growing regions of the world, which are generally between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, where conditions are ideal for coffee cherries to grow. We have teamed up with some great importers and farmers to get the absolute best coffee that benefits everyone involved, from the farmer to the importer to the coffee drinker here in Greenwood.
The coffees we source are, at a minimum, Fair Trade certified. The goal of Fair Trade is to create partnerships and terms of trade that will be financially and ethically beneficial to producers. In simpler terms, this means the beans we roast are bought at a fair price that allows the hardworking people growing the coffee to make a living off their wages.
Additionally, we will refer to some of the coffees we offer as “direct trade.” While there is no international certification for direct trade, as there is with Fair Trade, the general concept of direct trade is that our importers purchase beans directly from individual farmers. Fair Trade beans are typically purchased through coops, where several farmers deliver their beans which are then combined for sale, so there is no direct traceability of the bean back to a particular farm. With direct trade we are able to tell you the specific farmer who produced the beans. These beans are typically of the highest quality and the farmer ends up receiving a higher percentage of the price you pay for your coffee here in Greenwood.
Once the beans arrive at the coffeehouse in 50-65 pound bags and boxes, we then roast them on-demand in our roasting room. We use what is referred to as a fluid bed roaster, as opposed to a drum roaster used by most other coffee roasters. We believe there are some unique advantages to our fluid bed roasting process. The fluid bed roasting process, also known as hot air roasting, uses forced hot air to agitate and roast coffee beans. The perfectly controlled hot air flows over a tilted bed and circulates through the beans, roasting each bean evenly. This hot air reaches temperatures of between 450 and 485 degrees Fahrenheit.
We believe this method of roasting creates some of the best coffee you will ever taste for a few reasons. First, it has a unique method of removing the chaff that the coffee beans shed as they heat. This is important because coffee beans are so absorbent if the chaff remained in the chamber during the roast, as it does in drum roasters, it would soak up some of that unwanted flavor.
Another reason is its efficiency in heat transference. Our machine can reach higher temperatures in half of the time of many drum roasters, which is absolutely essential to ensuring a smooth cup of coffee with the least amount of acidity possible. Before the roasting process can truly extract the essential flavors of a given coffee bean, the natural moisture needs to be extracted and the longer it takes to do this the more time it allows for acids to build up and block the real flavor of the bean and potentially cause stomach irritation. So by reaching a higher temperature faster we minimize acid buildup and truly showcase the natural flavors of the bean.
Just like corn here in Indiana, coffee is a seasonal crop so you may notice different coffees during different times of the year. This is because we are committed to providing the freshest and tastiest cup of coffee we can, and that means sometimes a certain type of bean just isn’t in season.
We provide brief descriptions of each bean and blend on the bags. Our goal is to present highly drinkable coffee through blends and single-origins (more information about these terms is in the About Coffee section of the handbook).

# Controls and Basic Settings:

## Power Switch: 
The power switch is the upper-left knob on the main power system visible in the control panel. It turns stiffly, as it is a mechanical timer. The on position is fully clockwise, and the off position is fully anticlockwise. Its primary function is a safety switch; it will automatically switch off the roaster if not manually reset periodically. The switch can also function as a timer, in which case it operates as follows:
-> 9 o'clock: 10 minutes
-> 12 o'clock: 20-minutes
-> 3 o'clock: 30-minutes
Before charging the roaster with green beans, turn the switch fully on. Alternatively, set it to run for a little longer than the predicted time for the roast. If the roaster stops during the process, immediately turn the switch back on.

## Heater Control: 
The knob at the bottom-left of the control panel steplessly adjusts the heater current from fully-off to fully-on. As the heaters warm and cool, their resistance changes slightly, which causes the current to drift away somewhat from the intended setting. Thus, it is necessary to readjust the electrical current back to the desired setting a few minutes after changing the setting to obtain a precise heat level.

## Ammeter: The ammeter is on the upper-left of the control panel. It measures the electrical current flowing through the heaters. Each mark on the meter corresponds to 0.5-Ampere. One can convert the displayed electrical current to the consumed power with the formula P=I*E, where P is the power (watts), I is the current intensity (amperes), and E is the electromotive force (volts). Alternatively, use an energy monitor such as a KIll-a-Watt®.

## Blower Control: The blower is multi-purpose; it moves air through the roaster, removes chaff from the roasting chamber, and can cool the roasted beans. The knob at the bottom-right of the control panel steplessly adjusts the blower level. There are two versions of this control. On some models, the blower is always on. On other models, the blower stays off from the lowest setting to about 3.8, at which point it begins to turn. Although the dial has higher graduations, it does not turn past 8.

## Thermometer: The bean temperature displayed on the thermometer is a relative value, not the actual bean temperature. The BT indicated by thermometers on all roasters varies, mainly depending on the probe’s placement and the batch size. It is advisable to correlate the displayed temperature to the actual bean temperature at known points. The appendix contains a table to record corrected values for future reference. The temperature displayed via the ET port, on the other hand, is accurate.

## Circuit Breaker: 
The circuit breaker is at the roaster’s back, next to the power cord. It shuts down the roaster if there is a failure causing an excessive current draw. If the roaster does not operate, reset the breaker by depressing the button. If the breaker opens again, the roaster needs repair.

# Roasting process:
We roast our own coffee in the coffeehouse on a weekly basis. There are two primary things to know about our coffee roasting: the roasting degrees, the height of the coffee trays, and the oven temperatures.

## Roasting Degrees:

Coffee roasting is one of the most influential factors of coffee taste. Roasting transforms green beans into the aromatic and flavorful coffee that wakes our senses in the morning. However, roasting beans at various levels achieves more than merely darkening the bean; it also changes many of the beans’ physical attributes as well.

## Height of Coffee Trays:

Every coffee pile in a tray has a different height measured in mm (millimetres). Obviously, the higher the pile, the more heat an oven would require to achieve the desired roasting degree. The reverse effect happens on lower piles, which would require less oven heat. Therefore, the height of our coffee in the trays is a factor of most importance to the successful accomplishment of our excellent coffee roasting process and thus needs to be considered whenever analyzing a the result of a roasting process!

## Oven Temperatures:

In total our facility possesses 5 ovens, each oven is equipped with 3 heat state-of-the-art sensors. For our use-case, it is obviously important to analyze the highest and lowest temperatures recorded by the heat sensors. The lowest recordable temperature is 0° and the highest is 1000°. The sensors themselves were handcrafted by our own engineers who not only have years of background in the coffee roasting industry but also wanted to outdo themselves and create a unique temperature sensor specifically for our niche! If any damages or malfunctions are to be experienced, then it is crucial that the upper management is notified without any delays! Insulating the Roasting Chamber is also an option: Some owners add a layer of heat-proof insulation around the exterior of the roasting chamber. This insulation allows the Quest to retain more heat, increasing capacity and the speed of heating. However, the downside is that if the user wishes to dump heat when a roast is getting too hot, it will be slower.

## Roasting Guidelines:

In general, we first distinguish between three roasting degrees: light, medium and dark. Secondly, we have acknowledge the coffee pile height in the tray as that play a big role in the temperature of the roasting ovens which are the third and last constraint that needs to be abided to.

For better understanding, we describe temperature rules with boundary temperatures t_min and t_max and distinguish between:
	-> open brackets, e.g., (t_min, t_max), this means that the boundary temperatures ARE NOT included in the rules.
	-> closed brackets, e.g., [t_min, t_max], this means that the boundary temperatures ARE included in the rules.

	-> Light Roast:
	Goes through roasting oven 1,2 and 3.
	Light roasts are light brown with no oil on the bean surface, with a toasted grain taste and noticeable acidity. A common misconception is that Light Roasts don’t have as much caffeine as their darker, bolder counterparts. However, the truth is exactly the opposite! As beans roast, the caffeine slowly cooks out of the bean. Therefore, because lightly roasted beans cook for a shorter time and at a lower temperature, they retain more caffeine from the original green coffee bean. Other roasters refer to a Light Roast as Light City Roast, New England Roast, or Cinnamon Roast.
	
	We first distinguish between a tray height of less than 180mm and higher or equal to 180mm:
	
		--> Coffee tray height lower than 180mm:
			We inherently can not allow a temperature of roasting oven 1 to go below 120° or above 400°. Roasting oven 2 should maintain its temperature as [220°, 500°]. The final product will present a good quality if the highest temperatures of roasting oven 3 remain at 550°.
			
		--> Coffee tray height of at least 180mm:
			Roasting oven 1 should follow temperature rule [140°, 420°]. Afterwards, it is not allowed for roasting oven 2 to go above 520° or below 240°. Finally, the product will not pass the quality standard if roasting oven 3 fails to maintain its temperatures below 571°.
	
	
	-> Medium Roast:
	Goes through roasting oven 1,2,3 and 4.
	Medium roasts are medium brown to brown with no oil on the surface, although darker roasts in this group may appear slightly shiny. They are balanced, exhibiting significant flavor and aroma. Medium Roast coffees are brown and have a little thicker body than a Light Roast. Unlike Light, Medium starts to take on a bit of the taste from the roasting process, losing some of the bright floral flavors that are typical of a Light Roast. Instead, they carry much more of a balanced flavor with a medium amount of caffeine. A Medium is roasted until just before the second crack.
	For a successful medium roast of coffee beans the following technical requirements should be followed:
	
		--> Coffee tray height of at most 170mm:
			Temperatures of roasting 1 should follow [170°,450°].
			Temperatures of roasting 2 should follow [270°,550°].
			Temperatures of roasting 3 should follow [370°,650°].
			Temperatures of roasting 4 should not exceed 550°.
			
		--> Coffee tray height of at least 170mm:
			Temperatures of roasting 1 should avoid (0°,180°) and (460°,1000°).
			Temperatures of roasting 2 should avoid (0°,290°) and (570°,1000°).
			Temperatures of roasting 3 should avoid (0°,390°) and (670°,1000°).
			Temperatures of roasting 4 should reach at most 560°.
	
	
	-> Dark Roast:
	Dark roasts are dark brown to almost black, coffee beans roasted until they exude oils and therefore have an oil sheen glowing on the surface. The roasting process’s flavor overwhelms the beans’ flavor, and the coffee from some beans may taste spicy, bitter or smoky.	To be considered Dark, beans roast to a temperature of anything higher than 440° or essentially to the end of the second crack. If beans roast much hotter than 780°, the coffee will start to taste more and more of charcoal and will not pass the final quality check. This roasting degree is the only one that requires the use of roasting oven 5. If the coffee pile on the tray reaches 175mm and beyond, then the roasting oven 5 should not have its temperatures exceed 580°. Similarly, for coffee piles smaller than 175mm, roasting oven 5 should not go beyond 560°.
	Many other big-batch roasters cut corners by roasting larger quantities faster at extremely high temperatures for a short amount of time but it is important for us to still respect a new pattern of roasting beginning at oven chamber 1, if the coffee pile is at least 175mm high then roasting oven 1 should not exceed 580° and the lowest temperature allowed would be 220°, similarly for roasting oven 2 the temperatures reach at most 680° and go no lower than 320°. Continuing the process, if roasting oven 3 goes above 780° or if roasting oven 4 exceeds 680°, the final product will be rejected! The same outcome will happen if roasting oven 3 fails to maintain at least 421° or if roasting oven 4 goes lower than 320°.
	However, for piles of other heights, roasting oven 1 should remain between 200° and 560° including both temperatures. These piles of other sizes can also accept temperatures of at least 300° and up to 660° for roasting chamber 2, however, if they surpass 760° or if the temperature drops below 400° at roasting oven 3, then the final product will undoubtedly be rejected. Finally, please respect that in order to achieve the first crack in the coffee beans, oven chamber 4 should go as high as 680° but not drop below 320°.


# Additional Information

## Increasing Capacity by painting the drum
Some Quest owners–to increase the maximum batch capacity or alter the roast environment’s thermal dynamics–paint the roasting drum’s exterior with high-heat matte black spray paint. Doing so causes the drum to efficiently absorb and conduct more infrared heat to the roast chamber independent of airflow speed (convection). Increasing the drum’s ability to absorb infrared heat increases the batch capacity, and heat changes are faster, even for large batch sizes (EG. <10 minutes, 300g roasts on an 400° M3).

## Coffee Bean Cooling
The supplied rectangular bean collector placed in the chaff collector cools the beans. This works but has several drawbacks. First, it is slow. Second, there is no air circulation through the roasting chamber with the bean collector inserted into the chaff collector. Use an external cooler instead, such as the optional one from the manufacturer or make one. Make a small box with a muffin fan in it and set the bean collector on top. The flow of ambient air through the beans is much more efficient than the Quests’ inbuilt cooling function.
