Generally speaking, all visa types are issued by representation offices (→
BMEIA) abroad or, in specific exceptional cases, by certain border control
posts or, where extension of the visa is permitted, by the state police
headquarters.

Schengen visas must be issued by the representation office of the
country in which the main travel destination of the visa applicant is located.
If the applicant intends to spend an equal amount of time in several countries
(for example, when touring), the competent representation office is that of the
country in whose territory the main travel destination is located, on the basis
of the length and purpose of the stay. If it is not possible to determine a
main travel destination, the member country of first entry into the Schengen
area is responsible for issuing the visa.

Territorial competence for applications for category A and C visas falls to the
representation office in the consular district where the legal place of
residence of the applicant is located. A representation office may claim
exceptional competence for applications from third‑country nationals legally
residing but not registered in their district if the applicant can provide
justification as to why they had to submit their application to that particular
consulate.

Type D visas, however, must be applied for at the competent Austrian
representation. The provisions of Section 8 of the FPG apply to type D visas.
In accordance with these provisions, the territorial competence for carrying
out official actions in relation to visas is determined on the basis of the
foreign national's the place of residence (i.e. their centre of interest,
verifiable by means of e.g. registration forms, residence permit, visa).

A list of all representation offices (addresses, telephone numbers, opening
hours, special requirements for issuing visas etc.) can be found on the website
of the Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs.
